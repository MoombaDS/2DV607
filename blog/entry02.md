# First Steps
As someone relatively new to JavaScript as a whole, I've taken the past few days to dive into the basics and familiarise myself with the language as a whole. Once I'd managed to achieve some sort of grasp of the concepts, I moved on to React, Redux, and React Router. It took a fair bit of experimentation but I have begun to feel like I can understand how to use at least the former two tools with some minor degree of competence. Linking React and Redux was probably the part of the process that took the most time to properly acquaint myself with but I think I managed to get the hang of it!

Purely for entertainment value, a (partial) list of the minor problems I encountered along the way:
* Forgetting to rebuild after a minor change
* Forgetting a comma somewhere in the mix (this is probably the part of the syntax that is newest to me compared to previous languages)
* Typoing a single variable resulting in half an hour of debugging a blank page before realising the Firefox web console could tell me the problem in seconds

You can find my basic 'Hello World' app at: http://moombads.github.io/2DV607/ now with extra unnecessary features! As part of my experimentation with React, I decided to make the actual 'Hello World' portion unnecessarily complex by creating a React class with the sole purpose of rendering that small portion of html. This was really just my way of becoming more familiar with how React classes are called and structured. In addition to this, to familiarise myself with concepts further and to try out Redux, I added a generic Counter and TODO List element. The last is rather weak in terms of features, but I'd at least like to build on it to add marking tasks as done.

### Some resources which have been instrumental in getting me to where I am now:
