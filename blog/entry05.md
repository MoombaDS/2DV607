# Build Calculator Progress

I think I've finally begun to reach the point where I'm finding JavaScript to be a very enjoyable language to work in.

Aside from making the occasional pull request here and there, I've been working slowly on getting my "Build Calculator" up and running a bit more. So far it has some degree of functionality - individual "units" can be added as JSON files with the pertinent information, allowing the Branch components to place them in the correct positions on the tree. This makes it pretty easy for me to make fine adjustments to them in addition to easily adding new ones to the project!

To date, the working user-side features include:
* Clicking on the icons for individual "units" to add them to your "army"
* Removing "units" from your "army"
* Completely resetting everything
* Keeping track of remaining points (and refusing to let you spend too many!)

So not that interesting just yet. Feel free to check it out at http://moombads.github.io/2DV607/#/build?_k=e6cr9g anyway! At this stage I'm beginning to feel that this project will prove too trivial and am trying to come up with something I can use to expand the whole thing in some way - we'll see what I can come up with!
